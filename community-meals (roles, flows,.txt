A clear app outline (roles, flows, features)

A repo + folder structure suggestion

A phased timeline you can turn into GitHub milestones/issues

I’ll assume you’ll reuse your Expo/React Native + Node/Express setup since you already run that stack.

1. Core concept (MVP for 93230)

One-liner:
An app where people in 93230 can offer home-cooked meals (for free or low cost) and neighbors can claim them, with simple safety info and clear pickup rules.

User roles

Cooks

Post a meal (title, description, allergens, number of portions, time window, pickup location area).

Mark it as free or low-cost (like $3–$5 to cover ingredients).

Mark as claimed/out-of-stock.

Neighbors / Diners

See available meals near them (feed + map or at least list by distance).

Filter by time, dietary type (veg, halal, etc.), price (free only).

“Request” or “Reserve” a portion.

Admin (you)

Basic dashboard (even if it’s just a DB + a couple of endpoints or a simple admin screen later).

Ability to deactivate abusive users or meals.

2. MVP feature outline

Think in vertical slices – each slice delivers some end-to-end value.

Slice 1 – Onboarding & basic auth

Email + password login (or passwordless email magic link later).

Simple profile:

Name

Zip code (locked to 93230 for MVP)

“I cook / I eat / both”

Slice 2 – Meal posting (Cooks)

Create meal:

Title (e.g., “Chicken enchiladas”)

Short description

When it’ll be ready (date, time range)

Number of servings

Cost per serving (0 allowed)

Tags: {vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, pork, nut-free, etc.}

Status:

Open → Reserved → Completed / Cancelled

Slice 3 – Browsing & reserving (Diners)

Main home screen:

List of today + upcoming meals in 93230.

Filters: date, free-only, dietary tags.

Meal detail screen:

Cook’s name, rating (future), allergens, pickup instructions.

Button: Reserve serving(s).

Reservation flow:

User selects number of servings (within remaining availability).

Cook sees who reserved.

Slice 4 – Notifications & confirmations

In-app “Updates” feed for now (push notifications later):

“Your reservation is confirmed.”

“Cook marked your reservation as ready.”

Cooks can mark:

“Ready for pickup”

“Picked up”

Slice 5 – Safety & trust basics (MVP-level only)

Required checkbox when posting:

“I prepared this food at home and understand I’m responsible for its safety.”

A simple “Read before using this app” screen:

No guarantees of food safety.

Not for resale.

Encouraged to label allergens clearly.

3. Tech + GitHub repo structure

You can mirror your existing pattern: frontend & backend repos.

4. Timeline & GitHub milestones (approx. 8–10 weeks)

You can turn each Milestone into a GitHub Milestone and each bullet into issues.

Milestone 0 (Week 0–1): Project setup

Issues to create:

Initialize community-meals-client Expo app.

Initialize community-meals-backend Express app.

Add README.md in both repos describing the goal (93230 pilot, home-cooked meals).

Set up .editorconfig, .gitignore, basic eslint/prettier if you want.

Add /health endpoint in backend and test from client.

Milestone 1 (Week 1–2): Auth & profiles

Backend

Create User model (name, email, password hash, role: cook/diner/both, zip, createdAt).

/auth/register and /auth/login endpoints with JWT.

Middleware: authMiddleware.mjs to protect routes.

Frontend

LoginScreen, RegisterScreen, ProfileScreen.

Basic auth flow:

Save JWT in secure storage.

Redirect to Home after login.

GitHub Issues:

“Implement JWT-based login”

“Wire login screen to backend”

“Protect private routes in app”

Milestone 2 (Week 3–4): Meals CRUD (core of the app)

Backend

Meal model:

userId, title, description, tags, costPerServing, servingsTotal, servingsAvailable, readyAt, zip (default 93230), status.

Endpoints:

POST /meals (create meal)

GET /meals?zip=93230&from=<date> (public list)

GET /meals/:id

GET /meals/mine (for cooks)

PATCH /meals/:id (update / close)

Validations: servings ≥ 1, cost ≥ 0.

Frontend

CreateMealScreen, MyMealsScreen, MealFeedScreen, MealDetailScreen.

Meal cards + filters (today / tomorrow / free-only).

GitHub Issues:

“Implement meals CRUD endpoints”

“Create meal form UI with validation”

“Hook feed to GET /meals”

Milestone 3 (Week 5–6): Reservations & basic notifications

Backend

Reservation model:

userId (diner), mealId, servings, status (requested/confirmed/completed/cancelled).

Endpoints:

POST /meals/:id/reservations

GET /reservations/mine (diner view)

GET /meals/:id/reservations (cook view)

PATCH /reservations/:id (status changes).

On reservation creation, decrement servingsAvailable if confirmed.

Frontend

In MealDetailScreen:

Reserve servings.

Show your reservation status.

Simple “Updates” screen listing your reservations and status changes.

GitHub Issues:

“Reservation model and endpoints”

“Reserve servings flow on frontend”

“My reservations screen”

Milestone 4 (Week 7–8): Safety, polish, and 93230 pilot launch

Safety

SafetyInfoScreen with clear expectations and disclaimers.

Show link on first login + in profile/menu.

Polish

Basic theming: brand colors, buttons, consistent typography.

Error handling and loading states on all network calls.

Limit posting/browsing to zip 93230 (server-side check and client-side default).

Pilot readiness

Basic seed script for backend to create:

A couple of fake cooks and meals for demo.

Manual test run with a few real households in 93230.

GitHub issues:

“Add safety info screen and flow”

“Add app theming and finalize primary button styles”

“Limit meals to zip 93230 for MVP”

5. Nice-to-have backlog (GitHub “Future” milestone)

These are tickets you can park in a “Future” milestone:

Ratings & reviews for cooks.

In-app messaging between diner and cook.

Simple tip/donation integration (Stripe, etc.).

Map view using addresses or approximate location.

Photo upload for meals.

Push notifications for:

Reservation confirmed

Meal ready

Expansion to neighboring zips:

Config table of supported zips.

Admin panel for adding zips.

If you want, next step we can draft the first README.md and a GitHub milestones + issue list that you can literally paste into GitHub and start checking off.

You said:
Yes and should I save this first list? How and where?
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 12s

Yeah, absolutely save it. That “first list” is basically your v1 spec for the app. If you just leave it in this chat, you’ll lose track of it.

Here’s what I’d do, step-by-step.

1. Where to save it

Best place: inside your GitHub repo(s) for this project.

Use one repo to start (you can split client/backend later if you want):

community-meals

Inside that repo, make:

README.md → short overview + link to the plan

docs/MVP-plan.md → the full outline/timeline I gave you

That way, your “brains” for the project live with the code.

2. Concrete file setup

In your project folder:

mkdir community-meals
cd community-meals
git init
mkdir docs


Create README.md:

# Community Meals – 93230 Pilot

An app for local communities to share home-cooked meals for free or low cost.

- Pilot area: **93230 (Hanford, CA)**
- Users:
  - Cooks: post meals (free or low-cost)
  - Neighbors/Diners: reserve portions and pick up
- Status: Planning MVP

👉 See [docs/MVP-plan.md](docs/MVP-plan.md) for the feature outline and timeline.


Create docs/MVP-plan.md and paste the outline/timeline I gave you in the last message (roles, slices, milestones, etc.).

3. Save it in Git and push to GitHub

Once those files are created:

git add .
git commit -m "Add MVP plan and README"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git push -u origin main


Now your plan is:

Versioned

Safe in GitHub

Easy to turn into Issues and Milestones later
